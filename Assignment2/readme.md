##### Assignment 2 

*Sidhant Ahluwalia, Alexander Punj, and Hnin Oo Wai*

Apart from the gallery plugin something we went beyond the scope of the assignment was working with the content and the colors. If you have a closer look you will notice that the pallet resembles the colors of the city Murmansk, which we implemented to give a closer feel of the chosen city. In addition to this, we worked closely on discussing the content that should be on the page and how we relate to it, as part of the AI's job, we had to create new content for the Ontology (About me, Background and highlights) to best represent the team members.

#### Individual Tasks

**Information Architect (IA)** - The IA worked on curating the content of the 4 web pages including, but not limited to index, profiles, images and this readme. In addition to this, the information architect decided the placement of the navigation bar, text on the page, gallery using java plugin. The AI also worked on setting up the GitHub and using it to merge code add-ons throughout assignment 2. Part of the AI's job was to also make sure the team members are up to date and are understand their tasks for the assignment.

**Coder** -  The Coder worked closely with the designer on setting up the content on the page with different tags. One of the biggest tasks of the coder was to implement the JavaScript Plugin and separate reusable code such as the nav bar on a PHP file so the code can be accessed from multiple pages, increasing the productivity and efficiency of the code. 

**Designer** - The Designer worked towards creating an appealing appearance of the page including sizing the content and designing the theme of the pallet. The designer worked coherently with the coder in trying to make use of HTML tags to display information in a more structured form including working on accessibility issues, such as text being too small.
