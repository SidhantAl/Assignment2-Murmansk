	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>I'm from Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and formerly known as Burma, is a sovereign state in Southeast Asia. Myanmar is bordered by India and Bangladesh to its west, Thailand and Laos to its east and People's Republic of China to its north and northeast. To its south, about one third of Myanmar's total perimeter of 5,876 km (3,651 mi) forms an uninterrupted coastline of 1,930 km (1,200 mi) along the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. The country's 2014 census counted the population to be 51 million people. As of 2017, the population is about 54 million. Myanmar is 676,578 square kilometres (261,228 square miles) in size. Its capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city and former capital is Yangon (Rangoon). Myanmar has been a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) since 1997.</p>

	<h3>Highlight</h3>
	<p>One of my biggest highlights in college is working with Resnet, I've been assisting university students and staff with problems concerning wireless configuration, internet connectivity, university academic applications and software, and virus protection and removal either in person or via phone. In addition to this, I assist students with printing, scanning, copying and computer problems in the computer lab. Another highlight is to stubmle upon the area call Web Design and Development. So far it has been my favorite course. I would spend hours beautifying the site, picking colors and choosing fonts. It is so fun. I have just attended Wichack in RIT. Although our team didn't submit the demo, I learned a great deal developing a technical product. It is the best to have team with skilled and different talents.</p>
