	<h2>Team Roles</h2>

	<h4>Information Architect</h4>
	<h5>Sidhant Ahluwalia</h5>

	<p>I've chosen to be an IA as I have a good sense of what the role entails, I've had experience with working with webpages and their layouts in CSC 170 and various other CS class projects</p>

	<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Sidhant Ahluwalia, I'm a computer science major at the University of Rochester. My area of study is focused in Human-computer Interaction, ties in my interest in learning how design can make or break a product. </p>

	<p>I am looking to explore entrepreneurship from multiple aspects, being hands-on, developing a product and meanwhile also looking for disruptive tech as a venture capitalist. The skills to be a successful product manager resonate with what I do as a student on campus, running the entrepreneurship club, being a member of the SA Senate and being part of a student VC firm are all such examples. These experiences have taught me to handle multiple projects simultaneously and work with teams delegating tasks. I look forward to expanding my career post graduation</p>

	<h4>Designer</h4>
	<h5>Lotus May</h5>

	<p>Hours, minutes, and seconds cease When I let go my inner disease. Palettes of color exude their rgb While Mr. CSS hums his melody. In the world of web development Design is my ideal amusement.</p>

	<p>Hello! Welcome to my site. Let me introduce myself. Not to make you all confuse, I actually have three different names: Hnin Oo Wai, Lotus May and May Shin Lyan. The first is my official name which I hardly use in my personal life. The second is my pen name and the last is the name I use in my daily life. Forget all I say, you can call me May. :)</p>

	<p>I am majoring in Computer Science and Business with a cluster in Psychology and Korean language. LOVE PEACE AND COMPASSION are my bread and butter. Also, I am an ardent follower of Buddhism and interested in Vipassana Meditation. You are always welcome for a chat if you want to know more about meditation or may be you can teach me back.

	<h4>Coder</h4>
	<h5>Alexander Punj</h5>
	<p>I really enjoy writing and debugging web code. Web code is one subject that makes 100% sense to me and gets me excited to start my day. Over the semester break I ended up coding three websites, and enjoyed learning about new CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. You can visit them in the homepage.</p>

	<p>Hello! My name is Alexander Punj and I am a student at the University of Rochester! Before applying to colleges, my father and I went on a road trip starting at the University of Rochester and ending at MIT</p>
	<p> Along the way, we visited Hobart & William Smith Colleges, RPI, Clark University, Brandeis University, Bates College, and Bowdoin College before settling in central Boston. I enjoyed RPI, Rochester, Bowdoin and MIT the most out of that trip. The reason I chose to visit these colleges is that their admissions policy included optional submission of SAT and or ACT, as my test-taking skills were poor and was reflected on my SAT scores. I was leaning towards the University of Rochester because this school was the only one that offered an Audio & Music Engineering major. I applied to the university as an Early Applicant, and subsequently join the varsity tennis team when I entered. However, I have left that major as a minor and left the tennis team. I now am an Economics major with a minor in Audio & Music Engineering in my junior year.</p>
