	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I'm a computer science major at the University of Rochester. My area of study is focused in Human-computer Interaction, ties in my interest in learning how design can make or break a product. </p>

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Being brought up in Mumbai, India, has been a different experience of life as compared to that of Rochester. Mumbai is the capital city of Maharashtra & also the financial capital of India. A little-known fact, Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay. Mumbai is that part of India which works 24X7 and never sleeps. Marathi is the local language, but still, Hindi and English are also spoken fluently. Which is the reason why people traveling from various parts of the world not faces any kind of language constraints in Mumbai like other cities in India, making it a popular tourist spot for people located in various parts of the world. Another reason for having a number of visitors is due to Mumbai being the home to Bollywood, the second largest film industry in the world, right after Hollywood. In regards to the climate, the temperature in the city varies throughout the year. March to June are the summer months having a maximum temperature of around 40 degrees. June to October are the monsoon months with rain in its full force. November to February are the months of winter. Winters are mild in Mumbai because it is situated in the coastal region but the weather remains pleasant. An extensive network of these trains runs throughout the city- Harbor line, Central line and the Western line.</p>

	<h2>Highlight</h2>
	<p>Through the course of my college career I worked on various projects, but one in particular struck out, Gesture Link db, a project I worked on for my HCI class is a device that recognizes sounds made by different gestures which are then classified to do tasks. The purpose of creating gesture link was to help the handicapped and elderly to be able to control technology without having to go through the complicated setup process and controls. We approached the design to be simplistic and user friendly, gesture link uses python to classify different sounds, sources the numbers of highs in the frequency curve and does a resulting action. For the prototype we used a pair of standard apple microphone as the sound receiver and hosted a website to showcase the project with demos of dimming lights and turning them on/off. This is just one aspect of the endless possible actions gesture link can perform to help make technology easier for everyone.</p>
